The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `calc()` function and unexpected behavior with percentage values:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This *might* appear to work as expected, subtracting 10 pixels from 50% of the parent container's width. However, the result can be unexpected if the parent container's width itself is calculated dynamically or involves percentages.  The `calc()` function's order of operations might not be intuitive in nested percentage calculations.  The subtraction happens *after* the percentage calculation, leading to inconsistent results across different browser sizes or layouts.
