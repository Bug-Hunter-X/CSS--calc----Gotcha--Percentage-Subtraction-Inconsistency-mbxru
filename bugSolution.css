The solution is to avoid the problematic use of `calc()` with mixed percentage and pixel values when the parent container's width is not fixed or is also calculated dynamically. Here's an example using viewport units (vw) as a more robust alternative:

```css
.container {
  width: 40vw;
  /* Adjust 40vw as needed to match the desired percentage of the viewport */
  margin: 10px;
}
```

This approach removes the dependency on the parent container's percentage-based width and provides predictable results across different screen sizes.  For more complex scenarios, consider using media queries or JavaScript for more precise control.
